    "- Threading in programming is the use of multiple lines (or threads) in the same program at the same time. To work on multiple tasks simultaneously, it can generally be used to perform tasks with waiting I/O (Input/Output) or processing that can be divided into subtasks without waiting for the previous task to finish first.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The use of threading can improve data processing efficiency in some cases. This is because the CPU can be used simultaneously, for example when waiting for I/O such as reading/writing data from a file or connecting to a server. We can send I/O commands to related threads and keep other threads running. This reduces the time the program must wait to run without threads in use while waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- But the use of threading has become more complex. This is because one must be careful of the problem of sharing data between threads that can cause problems such as race condition or deadlock, which may cause the program to malfunction or become locked. Careful design and management can be done to reduce the risk of such problems occurring.\n",

    "> - async: This keyword is used to define a coroutine function. A coroutine function is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed at specific points using the await keyword. When a function is declared with the async keyword, it can contain one or more await expressions, allowing it to suspend its execution while waiting for some asynchronous operation to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - await: This keyword is used inside coroutine functions to pause execution until the result of an asynchronous operation is available. The await keyword can only be used within a coroutine function defined with the async keyword. When an await expression is encountered, the coroutine function suspends its execution until the awaited operation completes, at which point it resumes from where it left off.\n",
